                  <li>New to web programming, but familiar with some programming languages. I took a 1 week course offered by SAS in data mining, and find the huge variety of tools for exploring and explaining data fascinating. From past experiences I have come to the conclusion that the visualization of data is crucial in the interaction between engineers (us) and non engineers (clients or customers).</li>
