        <li>Industrial Engineer and Economist from Bogota, Colombia, currently living in West Lafayette.</li>
        <li>Currently enrolled in the second year of the Master in Science and Industrial Engineering.</li>
        <li>New to web programming, but familiar with some programming languages. I took a 1 week course offered by SAS in data mining, and find the huge variety of tools for exploring and explaining data fascinating. From past experiences I have come to the conclusion that the visualization of data is crucial in the interaction between engineers (us) and non engineers (clients or customers).</li>
